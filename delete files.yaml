To delete files using a Linux script, you can use the `rm` command. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Delete a single file
rm /path/to/file.txt

# Delete multiple files matching a pattern
rm /path/to/files/*.txt

# Delete all files in a directory
rm /path/to/files/*

# Delete files older than a certain number of days
find /path/to/files -type f -mtime +5 -exec rm {} \;
```

In the examples above, replace `/path/to/file.txt` or `/path/to/files` with the actual path to the file or directory you want to delete. Be cautious when using the `rm` command as it permanently deletes files without confirmation. Always double-check before running scripts that include file deletion commands.
