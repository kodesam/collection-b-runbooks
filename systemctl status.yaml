To get the status of a service using the `systemctl` command in Linux scripting, you can use the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

SERVICE_NAME="service_name"

status=$(systemctl is-active $SERVICE_NAME)

if [[ $status == "active" ]]; then
    echo "$SERVICE_NAME is running"
else
    echo "$SERVICE_NAME is not running"
fi
```

Replace `service_name` with the actual name of the service you want to check. This script will print whether the service is running or not.
