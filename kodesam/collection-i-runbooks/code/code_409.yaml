If you want to retrieve secrets in OpenShift using the `oc` command line tool, you can use the following command:

```
oc get secrets
```

This command will list all the secrets in your OpenShift cluster. Alternatively, you can specify a specific secret using:

```
oc get secret <secret-name>
```

Replace `<secret-name>` with the actual name of the secret you want to retrieve.

Please note that you need to be authenticated and have the necessary permissions to access secrets in your OpenShift cluster.
