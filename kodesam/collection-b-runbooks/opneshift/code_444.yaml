Sure! Here's an example Ansible script that uses the a10_server module to manage A10 Networks devices and pull Docker images:


---
- name: Pull Docker images on A10 Networks devices
  hosts: a10_devices
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Connect to A10 Networks device
      a10_server:
        provider:
          host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          username: admin
          password: password
        state: present

    - name: Configure Docker registry credentials
      a10_server_docker_image:
        provider:
          host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          username: admin
          password: password
        name: registry_credentials
        registry: my-docker-registry
        username: my-registry-username
        password: my-registry-password
        state: present

    - name: Pull Docker images
      a10_server_docker_image:
        provider:
          host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          username: admin
          password: password
        name: my-docker-image
        pull: yes
        state: present


In this script, make sure to replace `a10_devices` with the actual name of your Ansible inventory group that includes the A10 Networks devices you want to manage. Also, update the `host`, `username`, and `password` parameters with the correct credentials for your A10 Networks devices.

The script first connects to each A10 Networks device using the a10_server module. Then, it configures Docker registry credentials using the a10_server_docker_image module (`my-docker-registry`, `my-registry-username`, `my-registry-password`). Finally, it pulls a Docker image named `my-docker-image` using the same module.

You can save this script in a `.yaml` file, such as `pull_docker_images.yaml`, and run it using the `ansible-playbook` command:


ansible-playbook pull_docker_images.yaml


Make sure you have the `a10-networks-acos-cli` module installed on the system where you are running Ansible.
