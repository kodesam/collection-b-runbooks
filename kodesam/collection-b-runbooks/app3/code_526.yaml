Certainly! Here's an example of a Ansible playbook YAML that deploys a web application in a Kubernetes pod with secrets, configmap, services, and routes, along with an annotation for ArgoCD deployment:

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy Web Application with ArgoCD Annotation
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Create Secrets
      k8s:
        definition: |
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Secret
          metadata:
            name: my-secrets
          data:
            secret-key: BASE64_ENCODED_VALUE
        state: present

    - name: Create ConfigMap
      k8s:
        definition: |
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: ConfigMap
          metadata:
            name: my-configmap
          data:
            config-key: config-value
        state: present

    - name: Create Deployment
      k8s:
        definition: |
          apiVersion: apps/v1
          kind: Deployment
          metadata:

            annotations:
              argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=false
          spec:

            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: my-app
            template:
              metadata:
                labels:

              spec:
                containers:
                  - name: my-app-container

                    ports:
                      - containerPort: 8080
                    envFrom:
                      - secretRef:
                          name: my-secrets
                      - configMapRef:
                          name: my-configmap
        state: present

    - name: Create Service
      k8s:
        definition: |
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            name: my-app-service
          spec:
            selector:
              app: my-app
            ports:
              - protocol: TCP
                port: 80
                targetPort: 8080
        state: present

    - name: Create Route
      k8s:
        definition: |
          apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
          kind: Route
          metadata:
            name: my-app-route
          spec:
            to:
              kind: Service
              name: my-app-service
              weight: 100
            port:
              targetPort: 8080
            tls:
              termination: edge
        state: present
```

In this Ansible playbook, the tasks are defined to create the secrets, configmap, deployment, service, and route resources. The deployment resource also includes an annotation `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options` with the value `Prune=false` to control the ArgoCD deployment behavior.

You can customize the resource names, values, and annotations according to your specific requirements. Run this playbook using Ansible to deploy the web application with the specified resources and ArgoCD annotation.
