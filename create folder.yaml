To create a folder in a Linux environment using a shell script, you can use the `mkdir` command. Here's an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

folder_name="my_folder"  # Replace with the desired folder name

# Check if the folder already exists
if [ -d "$folder_name" ]; then
  echo "Folder $folder_name already exists."
else
  # Create the folder
  mkdir "$folder_name"
  echo "Folder $folder_name created successfully."
fi
```

Save the script in a file, for example, `create_folder.sh`, and make it executable by running the command `chmod +x create_folder.sh` in the terminal.
Then, you can execute the script by running `./create_folder.sh` in the terminal.

The script checks if the folder with the specified name already exists. If it exists, it displays a message stating that the folder already exists. Otherwise, it creates the folder using the `mkdir` command and displays a success message.
