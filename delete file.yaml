To delete a file in Linux scripting, you can use the `rm` command. Here's an example of how to delete a file named `example.txt`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file_path="/path/to/example.txt"

if [ -f "$file_path" ]; then
  rm "$file_path"
  echo "File deleted successfully."
else
  echo "File does not exist."
fi
```

In this script, the variable `file_path` holds the path to the file you want to delete. The script checks if the file exists using the `-f` flag with the conditional `if [ -f "$file_path" ]`. If the file exists, the script executes the `rm` command with the file path to delete it. Finally, it prints a success message if the file is deleted, or an error message if the file does not exist.

Make sure to replace `/path/to/example.txt` with the actual path to the file you want to delete. Also, ensure that you have appropriate permissions to delete the file.
