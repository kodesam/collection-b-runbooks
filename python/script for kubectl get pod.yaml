If you're looking to run the `kubectl get pod` command using shell scripting, a basic script can be written as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

kubectl get pods
```

To create and run the script, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor and copy the above script into a new file, e.g., `get-pods.sh`.

2. Save the file and close the text editor.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script file, and run the following command to make the file executable:

```
chmod +x get-pods.sh
```

4. Finally, execute the script by running the command:

```
./get-pods.sh
```

The script will execute the `kubectl get pods` command and display a list of the pods in your Kubernetes cluster.

Make sure you have the `kubectl` command-line tool installed and correctly configured to access your cluster.
