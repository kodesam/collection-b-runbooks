To run `kubectl get pod` command in Python, you can use the `subprocess` module to execute the command and capture the output. Here's an example:

```python
import subprocess

# Run the command
output = subprocess.check_output(["kubectl", "get", "pod"])

# Print the output
print(output.decode())
```

This code will execute the `kubectl get pod` command and print the output to the console. You can also store the output in a variable or process it further as needed.
