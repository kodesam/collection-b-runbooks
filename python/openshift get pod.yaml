To execute the `openshift get pod` command in a Jupyter notebook using Python, you can utilize the `subprocess` module:

Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import subprocess

# Define the openshift command
openshift_command = "oc get pod"

# Run the command and capture the output
output = subprocess.check_output(openshift_command.split())

# Decode the byte output to string
output = output.decode("utf-8")

# Print the output
print(output)
```

This code will run the `oc get pod` command and print the output in the notebook. Make sure you have the `oc` binary set up in your environment and have the necessary permissions to execute the command.
