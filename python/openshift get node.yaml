You can use the OpenShift Python library to interact with the OpenShift API and get information about nodes. Here's an example of how to get node information using the OpenShift Python library:

```python
from openshift import client, config

# Load OpenShift configuration from default location
config.load_kube_config()

# Create a client to interact with the OpenShift API
oapi_client = client.OapiApi()

# Get the list of nodes
resp = oapi_client.list_node()

# Process the response and print node details
for node in resp.items:
    print("Node Name:", node.metadata.name)
    print("Node Status:", node.status.phase)
    # You can access more details about the node using other properties in the `node` object
    print("---------------")
```

Make sure you have the `openshift` library installed before running the above code. You can install it using `pip install openshift`.
