You can use the `command` or `shell` module in Ansible to execute the `kubectl get services` command. Here's an example in Ansible playbook:

```
---
- name: Execute kubectl get services
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Run kubectl get services
      command: kubectl get services
```

In this playbook, we specify `hosts: localhost` to run the task on the local machine. You can replace `localhost` with the appropriate host(s) where you want to execute the command.

Save this playbook as `kubectl.yaml` and run it using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```
ansible-playbook kubectl.yaml
```

This will execute the `kubectl get services` command on the specified host(s) and display the output.
