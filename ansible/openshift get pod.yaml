To execute the `oc get pod` command in Ansible to get the pods in OpenShift, you can use the `command` module. Here's an example of how you can do it in an Ansible playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Execute oc get pod command
  hosts: your_servers
  
  tasks:
    - name: Run oc get pod command
      command: oc get pod
      register: oc_output
      
    - name: Print oc output
      debug:
        var: oc_output.stdout_lines
```

Replace `your_servers` with the name of the target servers where OpenShift is installed. The `command` module will execute the `oc get pod` command on the target servers, and the output will be saved in the `oc_output` variable. Finally, the `debug` module will print the output of the `oc` command.

You can run this playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```shell
ansible-playbook your-playbook.yml
```

Ensure that you have Ansible installed and configured to connect to your target servers with the necessary privileges to run the `oc` command.
