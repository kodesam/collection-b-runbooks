Here's an example of an Ansible playbook that creates a deployment with secrets, configmap, service, and route using input parameters in Jinja templates:

```yaml
---
- name: Create deployment with secrets, configmap, service, and route
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  vars:
    deployment_name: my-deployment
    secrets:
      - name: db-password
        value: "{{ db_password }}"
      - name: api-key
        value: "{{ api_key }}"
    configmap:
      - name: app-config
        value:
          app_name: my-app
          app_env: "{{ app_env }}"
    service_name: my-service
    route_host: "{{ route_host }}"

  tasks:
    - name: Create secrets
      k8s:
        state: present
        definition:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Secret
          metadata:
            name: "{{ item.name }}"
          type: Opaque
          data:
            password: "{{ item.value | b64encode }}"
        with_items: "{{ secrets }}"

    - name: Create configmap
      k8s:
        state: present
        definition:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: ConfigMap
          metadata:
            name: "{{ item.name }}"
          data: "{{ item.value }}"
        with_items: "{{ configmap }}"

    - name: Create service
      k8s:
        state: present
        definition:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            name: "{{ service_name }}"
          spec:
            selector:
              app: "{{ deployment_name }}"
            ports:
              - name: http
                port: 80
                targetPort: 8080
        register: service_result

    - name: Create route
      k8s:
        state: present
        definition:
          apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
          kind: Route
          metadata:
            name: "{{ deployment_name }}"
          spec:
            host: "{{ route_host }}"
            to:
              kind: Service
              name: "{{ service_name }}"
        register: route_result
```

In this example, you need to replace the following variables with your own values:

- `deployment_name`: The name of the deployment.
- `secrets`: List of secrets with their names and values.
- `configmap`: List of configmaps with their names and values.
- `service_name`: The name of the service.
- `route_host`: The hostname for the route.

You can run this playbook using the following command:


```bash
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yaml --extra-vars "db_password=secretpassword api_key=apikeyvalue app_env=production route_host=mydomain.com"
```
