Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I cannot play songs directly. However, I can provide you with instructions to play songs on different platforms.

1. Spotify: If you have the Spotify app installed, you can use the following command to play a song using Ansible:

```yaml
- name: Play a song on Spotify
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Open Spotify app
      command: open -a Spotify

    - name: Play a song
      command: osascript -e 'tell application "Spotify" to play track "spotify:track:{YOUR_TRACK_ID}"'
```

Replace `{YOUR_TRACK_ID}` with the Spotify track ID of the song you want to play.

2. YouTube: If you want to play a song on YouTube, you can use Ansible to open a web browser and play the song by opening the YouTube URL:

```yaml
- name: Play a song on YouTube
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Open YouTube
      command: open "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={YOUR_VIDEO_ID}"
```

Replace `{YOUR_VIDEO_ID}` with the YouTube video ID of the song you want to play.

Please note that you will need the respective applications (Spotify or a web browser with YouTube) installed for the above instructions to work.
