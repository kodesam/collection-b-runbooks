To execute systemctl commands using Ansible, you can utilize the Ansible `systemd` module. Here's an example of how you can use it in an Ansible playbook to run various systemctl commands:

```yaml
---
- name: Execute systemctl commands
  hosts: your_servers
  
  tasks:
    - name: Start a service
      systemd:
        name: your_service
        state: started
  
    - name: Stop a service
      systemd:
        name: your_service
        state: stopped
  
    - name: Restart a service
      systemd:
        name: your_service
        state: restarted
  
    - name: Enable a service
      systemd:
        name: your_service
        state: enabled
  
    - name: Disable a service
      systemd:
        name: your_service
        state: disabled
```

Replace `your_service` with the name of the service you want to control. In this playbook, the `systemd` module is used with different values of the `state` parameter to start, stop, restart, enable, or disable a particular service.

You can also execute other systemctl commands using the `shell` module. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```yaml
---
- name: Execute systemctl commands
  hosts: your_servers
  
  tasks:
    - name: Execute systemctl command
      shell: systemctl <your_command>
      ignore_errors: true
```

Replace `<your_command>` with the systemctl command you want to execute. The `ignore_errors` parameter is set to true to prevent Ansible from failing if the systemctl command returns a non-zero exit code.

Remember to replace `your_servers` with the appropriate values, and execute the playbook using `ansible-playbook your-playbook.yml`.
