To retrieve information about services in OpenShift using Ansible, you can use the `oc` command module. Here's an example playbook to get services in OpenShift:

```yaml
---
- name: Get OpenShift Services
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Login to OpenShift
      oc_login:
        server_url: "https://api.example.com"
        username: "admin"
        password: "password"

    - name: Get Services
      command: oc get services -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'
      register: services_output

    - name: Print Services
      debug:
        var: services_output.stdout_lines
```

Ensure to replace the `server_url`, `username`, and `password` with your OpenShift credentials. The playbook first authenticates with the OpenShift cluster using the `oc_login` module. Then, it uses the `command` module to execute the `oc get services` command and captures the output in the `services_output` variable. Finally, the playbook prints the services using the `debug` module.

You can execute the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook get_services.yaml
```

Note: You may need to install the `openshift` module for Ansible if it's not already installed:

```bash
pip install openshift
```

This playbook retrieves the list of services in OpenShift and prints them. Feel free to modify it according to your requirements.
