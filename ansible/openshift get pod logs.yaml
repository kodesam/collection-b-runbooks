To get pod logs in Ansible, you can use the `k8s` module. Here's an example playbook that demonstrates how to fetch pod logs from an OpenShift cluster:

```yaml
---
- name: Fetch pod logs from OpenShift cluster
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Fetch pod list
      k8s_info:
        api_version: v1
        kind: Pod
        label_selectors:
          - app=myapp  # Replace with the label selector for your pods
      register: pod_info

    - name: Fetch pod logs
      k8s_status:
        api_version: v1
        kind: Pod
        name: "{{ item.metadata.name }}"
        container: "{{ item.spec.containers[0].name }}"
        namespace: "{{ item.metadata.namespace }}"
      register: pod_logs
      loop: "{{ pod_info.resources }}"

    - name: Display pod logs
      debug:
        var: item.result.stdout
      loop: "{{ pod_logs.results }}"
```

In this example, we first use the `k8s_info` module to fetch the list of pods based on the label selector (`app=myapp`). The output is stored in the `pod_info` variable.

Then, in the second task, we use the `k8s_status` module inside a loop to fetch the logs for each pod. We provide the pod name, container name, and the namespace.

Finally, we display the logs using the `debug` module.

Make sure you have the `openshift` and `kubernetes` Python libraries installed on the machine where you run this playbook. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install openshift kubernetes
```

Please modify the playbook according to your specific requirements, such as the label selector and the containers to fetch logs from.
