To retrieve information about Persistent Volumes (PVs) in OpenShift using Python, you can use the OpenShift Python client library. Here's an example code snippet to get PVs:

```python
from openshift import config, client

# Load OpenShift configuration
config.load_kube_config()

# Create an OpenShift API client
api_client = client.ApiClient()

# Get the PVs
v1_client = client.CoreV1Api(api_client)
pv_list = v1_client.list_persistent_volume()

# Print PV details
for pv in pv_list.items:
    pv_name = pv.metadata.name
    pv_status = pv.status.phase
    
    print(f"PV Name: {pv_name}")
    print(f"Status: {pv_status}")
    print("---------------------")
```

In this example, the `config.load_kube_config()` function is used to load the OpenShift configuration from the default location (`~/.kube/config`). You can provide a custom configuration file path if necessary.

The code creates an OpenShift API client using the `client.ApiClient()` function. Then, it uses the `list_persistent_volume()` method from the `CoreV1Api` client to retrieve the list of PVs.

Finally, it iterates over the PV list and prints the name and status of each PV.

Make sure you have the `openshift` Python library installed by running `pip install openshift` before executing the code.

Note: This code assumes that you have the necessary permissions to access PVs in the OpenShift cluster.
