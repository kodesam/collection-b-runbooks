To initiate a system reboot using Linux scripting, you can use the `reboot` command. Here's an example:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

echo "Initiating system reboot..."
sudo reboot
```

Save the above code in a file, for example, `reboot.sh`, and make it executable using the `chmod` command:

```shell
chmod +x reboot.sh
```

When you execute the script with `sudo`, it will display a message "Initiating system reboot..." and then reboot the system using the `sudo reboot` command. Please note that you'll need appropriate permissions to execute the `sudo` command.

Remember to save any unsaved work before running the script as the system will reboot immediately.
