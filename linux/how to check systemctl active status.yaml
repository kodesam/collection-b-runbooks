To check the active status of a service using `systemctl` on Linux, you can use the following command:

```
systemctl is-active <service-name>
```

Replace `<service-name>` with the name of the service you want to check. For example, to check the active status of the nginx service, you would run:

```
systemctl is-active nginx
```

This command will output `active` if the service is currently running, or `inactive` if it is not running.
