To check the active status of a service using `systemctl`, you can execute the following command:

```
systemctl is-active <service-name>
```

Replace `<service-name>` with the name of the service you want to check. For example, to check the active status of the NGINX service, you can run:

```
systemctl is-active nginx
```

The command will return one of the following outputs:

- `active` if the service is active
- `inactive` if the service is not active
- `unknown` if the status of the service cannot be determined

You can use this command as part of your Ansible playbook or directly on the command line.
