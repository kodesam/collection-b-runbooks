To delete files in Linux, you can use the `rm` command. Below are some examples of how you can use it:

1. Delete a single file:
```
rm file.txt
```

2. Delete multiple files:
```
rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

3. Delete all files in a directory:
```
rm *
```
Note: This will delete all files in the current directory.

4. Delete files in a specific directory:
```
rm /path/to/directory/*
```
Note: This will delete all files in the specified directory.

5. Delete files recursively in a directory (including subdirectories):
```
rm -r /path/to/directory/
```
Note: This will delete all files and directories within the specified directory.

Please be cautious when using the `rm` command as it permanently deletes files and they cannot be recovered.
