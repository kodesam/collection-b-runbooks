To delete multiple files in Linux, you can use the `rm` command along with a pattern or a list of filenames. Here are a few examples:

1. Delete all files with a specific extension:
```shell
rm -r /path/to/files/*.txt
```

2. Delete all files with a specific prefix:
```shell
rm -r /path/to/files/prefix_*
```

3. Delete specific files:
```shell
rm -r /path/to/files/file1.txt /path/to/files/file2.txt
```

4. Delete files using a wildcard pattern:
```shell
rm -r /path/to/files/file*
```

5. Delete files recursively from a directory:
```shell
rm -r /path/to/files/
```

Please be cautious when using the `rm` command as it permanently deletes the specified files and they cannot be recovered easily. It's always a good practice to double-check the files you are deleting before executing the command.
