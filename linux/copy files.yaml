To copy files in Linux, you can use the `cp` command. Here's the basic syntax:

```
cp source_file destination_directory
```

Here are a few examples of how you can use the `cp` command:

1. Copy a file to a directory:
   ```
   cp file.txt /path/to/directory/
   ```

2. Copy a file and rename it:
   ```
   cp file.txt /path/to/directory/new_file.txt
   ```

3. Copy multiple files to a directory:
   ```
   cp file1.txt file2.txt /path/to/directory/
   ```

4. Copy all files from a directory to another directory:
   ```
   cp /path/to/source_directory/* /path/to/destination_directory/
   ```

Remember to replace `source_file` with the actual file you want to copy and `destination_directory` with the directory where you want to copy the file.

If you're working with Ansible, you can use the `copy` module to copy files. Here's an example playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Copy files
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Copy file to destination
      copy:
        src: /path/to/source/file.txt
        dest: /path/to/destination/directory/
```

Replace `/path/to/source/file.txt` with the actual path of the file you want to copy and `/path/to/destination/directory/` with the path of the directory where you want to copy the file to.
