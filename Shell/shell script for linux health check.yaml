Sure! Here's an example of a shell script for performing a basic health check on Linux:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check CPU usage
cpu_usage=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')
echo "CPU Usage: $cpu_usage"

# Check memory usage
memory_usage=$(free | awk '/Mem/{printf("%.2f%"), $3/$2*100}')
echo "Memory Usage: $memory_usage"

# Check disk usage
disk_usage=$(df -h --output=pcent / | tail -n 1)
echo "Disk Usage: $disk_usage"

# Check load average
load_average=$(uptime | awk -F 'load average:' '{print $2}')
echo "Load Average: $load_average"

# Check network connectivity
ping -c 1 google.com > /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Network Connectivity: Online"
else
  echo "Network Connectivity: Offline"
fi
```

This script checks the CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, load average, and network connectivity. You can customize or add additional checks as per your requirements.

Save the above code in a file (e.g., `health_check.sh`) and make it executable using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x health_check.sh
```

To run the script, simply execute:

```bash
./health_check.sh
```

The script will print the output of each health check.
