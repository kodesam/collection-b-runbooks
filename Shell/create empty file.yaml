To create an empty file using Linux scripting, you can use the `touch` command.

Here's an example of a shell script that creates an empty file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

filename="example.txt"

touch "$filename"

echo "Empty file created: $filename"
```

In this script, we have created a variable `filename` and assigned it the value "example.txt". The `touch` command is then used with the `$filename` variable to create the empty file.

After executing this script, an empty file named "example.txt" will be created in the same directory where the script resides.

You can save this script to a file (e.g., create_empty_file.sh) and make it executable using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x create_empty_file.sh
```

Then, you can run the script using:

```bash
./create_empty_file.sh
```

This will create the empty file and display a message confirming the creation.
