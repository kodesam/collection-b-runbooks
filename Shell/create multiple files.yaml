To create multiple files in Linux using shell scripting, you can use a loop along with the `touch` command. Here's an example:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Specify the names of the files to create
files=("file1.txt" "file2.txt" "file3.txt")

# Loop through the file names and create each file
for file in "${files[@]}"
do
    touch "$file"
    echo "Created file: $file"
done
```

In this shell script, we define an array `files` that contains the names of the files we want to create. The `for` loop iterates over each file name in the array and uses the `touch` command to create the file. It also echoes a message indicating that each file has been created.
