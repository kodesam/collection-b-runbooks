To copy a file from one server to another server using Linux shell scripting, you can use the `scp` command.

Here's an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
source_server="user@source_server_ip"
destination_server="user@destination_server_ip"
source_file="/path/to/source/file.txt"
destination_directory="/path/to/destination_directory/"

# Copy file from source server to local machine
scp $source_server:$source_file $destination_server:$destination_directory
```

Replace `user` with the username for both the source and destination servers, `source_server_ip` with the IP address or hostname of the source server, `destination_server_ip` with the IP address or hostname of the destination server, `/path/to/source/file.txt` with the path to the file you want to copy from the source server, and `/path/to/destination_directory/` with the directory where you want to copy the file on the destination server.

Save the script to a file (e.g., `copy_file.sh`), give it execute permissions (`chmod +x copy_file.sh`), and then run it using `./copy_file.sh` on the source server. The script will use `scp` to securely copy the file from the source server to the destination server.
